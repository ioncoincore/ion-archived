Recommended Update
==================

Ion Core version 3.0.5 is a recommended update for all users. This release
contains new hardcoded checkpoints to guard against forks in the network.

If your client is only finding limited peers or sending and receiving coins
aren't reaching their destination you may need to upgrade to this version and
perform a resync of the blockchain.

How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Ion-Qt` (on Mac)
or `iond`/`ion-qt` (on Linux).

Compatibility
=============

Ion Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using
the Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later. Windows XP is not supported.

Ion Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not
frequently tested on them.
