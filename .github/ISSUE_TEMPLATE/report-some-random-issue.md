General ion questions and/or support requests are best directed to the ionomy support support@ionomy.com, Ionomy Discord https://discord.gg/vuZn7gC or even  on Bitcoin StackExchange at https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com.

If the node is "stuck" during sync or giving "block checksum mismatch" errors, please ensure your hardware is stable by running memtest and observe CPU temperature with a load-test tool such as linpack before creating an issue! -->

<!-- Describe the issue -->
<!--- What behavior did you expect? -->

<!--- What was the actual behavior (provide screenshots if the issue is GUI-related)? -->

<!-- What version of Ion Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)? -->

<!-- What type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)? -->
